### About
This is the ***Minesweeper*** project I made myself while studying at [JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org)
<p>They say a minesweeper makes only two mistakes in their life: the first is their choice of occupation, and the second one is fatal. In this project, you will create your own, safe "Minesweeper" â€“ a game that will be a brain teaser for both you and your players.</p>
This project is a part of the following tracks:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://hyperskill.org/tracks/18">Kotlin Core</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://hyperskill.org/tracks/3">Kotlin Developer</a></li>
</ul>

### Learning outcomes
<p>This project will teach you how to work with lists in Kotlin. You will be dealing with algorithms for generating the minefield and processing the player moves.</p>
